# Workflow Status Report
**Date**: 2025-08-07
**Workflow ID**: ixbSnRIIcxZnJVjR
**Name**: Monday.com AI Tasks Generator - Simplified Owner Assignment

## Current Issues

### 1. Data Loss After Group Creation ❌
**Problem**: When a new group is created, the "Split Tasks With Owners" node loses the task data.

**Root Cause**: 
- The node receives data from either the "IF - Group Exists" branch OR the "Monday - Create Group" node
- When coming from "Monday - Create Group", it only has the group ID (`{id: "group_xyz"}`)
- The original task data from "Process Bulk Lookup" is lost

**Fix Needed**: 
The "Split Tasks With Owners" node needs to be updated to:
```javascript
// Get the original data with tasks from Process Bulk Lookup
const originalData = $('Process Bulk Lookup').item.json;
```

### 2. Fixed Issues ✅

#### Process Bulk Lookup Data Loss - FIXED
- Changed from `$input.first().json` to `$('Prepare Bulk User Lookup').item.json`
- Now correctly preserves all fields including boardId

## Workflow Flow

1. **Webhook** → Receives project data
2. **Validate** → Validates input
3. **AI Generate** → Creates 10 tasks
4. **Parse AI** → Processes tasks
5. **User Lookup Prep** → Prepares email lookup
6. **Monday Bulk Lookup** → Gets user IDs
7. **Process Bulk Lookup** → Maps emails to IDs ✅
8. **IF Group Exists** → Checks if groupId provided
   - Yes → Split Tasks
   - No → Create Group → Split Tasks ❌ (loses data here)
9. **Split Tasks** → Creates 10 items
10. **Prep Item** → Adds owner data
11. **Create Item** → Creates in Monday.com
12. **Summary** → Returns success

## Test Results

### Last Test: 2025-08-07 14:08
- **Status**: FAILED
- **Error**: "No tasks array found" at Split Tasks node
- **Cause**: Data loss after group creation
- **Owner Lookup**: ✅ Working (found user ID 79424937)

## Next Steps

1. Fix the "Split Tasks With Owners" node to retrieve original data from "Process Bulk Lookup"
2. Test with group creation scenario
3. Verify all 10 tasks are created with proper owner assignment
