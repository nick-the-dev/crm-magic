**Name**: Monday.com AI Tasks Generator - Simplified Owner Assignment

## Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. Data Loss After Group Creation ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: When a new group is created, the "Split Tasks With Owners" node loses the task data.

- Now retrieves data from the correct source node regardless of branch

### 2. Owner Assignment Format ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Owner column not being set correctly in Monday.com

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed the `project_owner` column value format
- Ensured owner ID is parsed as integer
- Added proper JSON structure for people column
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### 3. User Lookup Error Handling ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem**: Silent failures during user lookup

**Solution Applied**:
- Added comprehensive logging to track lookup results
- Added error detection for GraphQL errors
- Better console output for debugging
