# Deployment Instructions - Owner Assignment Fix

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Data Preservation Issue
**Problem:** When creating a new group, the workflow lost task data.
**Fix:** Updated "Split Tasks With Owners" node to use `$('Process Bulk Lookup').item.json` to always retrieve data from the correct source.

### 2. Owner Assignment Format
**Problem:** Owner column wasn't being set correctly.
**Fix:** Ensured proper JSON structure for Monday.com people column with integer user IDs.

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
**Problem:** Silent failures during user lookup.
**Fix:** Added comprehensive logging throughout the workflow.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to n8n
1. Open n8n: `https://automations-n8n.u841sv.easypanel.host`
2. Go to workflow: `ixbSnRIIcxZnJVjR`
3. Click "Settings" → "Import from File"
4. Upload: `workflows/monday-tasks-generator-enhanced.json`
5. Save and Activate the workflow

### Step 2: Verify Deployment
Run this test command:
```bash
node test/test-owner-assignment.js
```

### Step 3: Check Monday.com
1. Go to board: `https://monday.com/boards/9744010967`
2. Look for newly created tasks
3. Verify the "Owner" column is populated with "Nick Gluk" (user ID: 79424937)

### Step 4: Verify in n8n Executions
1. Go to: `https://automations-n8n.u841sv.easypanel.host/workflow/ixbSnRIIcxZnJVjR/executions`
2. Check the latest execution
3. Look for these success indicators:
   - "✅ Mapped gluknik+1@gmail.com -> 79424937"
   - "✅ Setting owner with ID: 79424937"
   - No error nodes (all green)

## Expected Results

When working correctly, you should see:
- **10 tasks created** in Monday.com
- **Owner column populated** with the assigned user
- **Workflow execution time** under 20 seconds
- **Success response** from webhook

## If Owner Assignment Still Doesn't Work

### Quick Fixes to Try:

1. **Check Column ID:**
   The workflow assumes the owner column ID is `project_owner`. If different, update line 195 in the workflow JSON.

2. **Test User Lookup:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
     -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query":"query { users(emails: [\"gluknik+1@gmail.com\"]) { id name email } }"}'
   ```

3. **Alternative Column Format:**
   In the "Prep Item With Owner" node, try:
   ```javascript
   columnValues.project_owner = ownerId.toString();
   ```

## Files Changed

- `workflows/monday-tasks-generator-enhanced.json` - Main workflow file with fixes
- `docs/workflow-status.md` - Updated status documentation
- `docs/troubleshooting-owner-assignment.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- `test/test-owner-assignment.js` - Test script for verification

## Critical Success Criteria

**DO NOT PUSH TO GITHUB UNTIL:**
- [ ] Workflow deployed to n8n
- [ ] Test execution successful
- [ ] Tasks created in Monday.com
- [ ] **OWNER ASSIGNED TO TASKS** (most important!)
- [ ] No errors in n8n execution logs

## Support

If issues persist after deployment:
1. Check n8n execution logs for specific errors
2. Review `docs/troubleshooting-owner-assignment.md`
3. Verify Monday.com API credentials are valid
4. Test with a simpler payload first
